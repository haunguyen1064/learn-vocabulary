# TOEIC Vocabulary Auto-Import Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically imports 603 TOEIC vocabulary words to a new user's account when they successfully register.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **`src/services/vocabularyService.ts`**
   - Added `addWordsInBatch()` function for efficient batch word creation
   - Added `importToeicVocabulary()` function to transform and import TOEIC vocabulary
   - Handles batch operations with Firebase's 500-operation limit per batch

2. **`src/services/firebase.ts`**
   - Modified `registerWithEmail()` to automatically call vocabulary import
   - Added error handling to ensure account creation succeeds even if vocabulary import fails
   - Import happens after user document creation

3. **`src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`**
   - Enhanced with loading messages during registration process
   - Shows progress: "Creating account..." → "Setting up vocabulary..." → "Finalizing..."
   - Improved user experience with loading states

4. **`src/vite-env.d.ts`**
   - Added TypeScript declarations for JSON module imports
   - Specific type definitions for TOEIC vocabulary structure

5. **`README.md`**
   - Updated with documentation about the new auto-import feature

### Data Transformation

The TOEIC vocabulary JSON structure:
```json
{
  "word": "agreement",
  "pronounce": "/ə'gri.mənt/",
  "meaning": "một thỏa thuận chung, một hợp đồng"
}
```

Is transformed to match the app's `VocabularyWord` interface:
```typescript
{
  word: "agreement",
  partOfSpeech: "unknown", // TOEIC data doesn't include this
  meaning: "một thỏa thuận chung, một hợp đồng",
  example: "Pronunciation: /ə'gri.mənt/", // Using pronunciation as example
  status: "new",
  masteryLevel: 0,
  timesReviewed: 0,
  timesCorrect: 0
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- Uses Firebase batch writes (max 500 operations per batch)
- Processes 603 words in 2 batches: 500 + 103
- Non-blocking: Account creation succeeds even if vocabulary import fails
- Import happens asynchronously after user document creation

### User Experience

- Clear loading messages during registration
- Seamless integration - users don't need to take any additional action
- 603 TOEIC vocabulary words are immediately available for study
- Users can start practicing vocabulary right after registration

### Error Handling

- Vocabulary import errors are logged but don't prevent account creation
- User receives their account even if vocabulary import fails
- Console logging for debugging vocabulary import issues

## Testing

✅ TOEIC vocabulary data validated:
- 603 total words
- All entries have required fields (word, meaning, pronounce)
- Proper JSON format
- Successfully imports into application format

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Allow users to choose which vocabulary sets to import during registration
2. Add progress indicators for large vocabulary imports
3. Support for additional vocabulary sets (GRE, SAT, etc.)
4. Option to re-import or update vocabulary sets after registration
